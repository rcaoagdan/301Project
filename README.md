## Project Description 
Scenario A: SunToWater

* Your team is tasked with updating the core IT infrastructure of a recent GlobeX acquisition, SunToWater. SunToWater's mission is to make water-from-air drinking water more accessible to families. This ecological, energy-conversion focus aligns well with the mission of GlobeX, but unfortunately, its IT systems do not.

* Because SunToWater currently lacks a client-server, domained network, your team is assigned with developing a repeatable means of standing up a DC to oversee SunToWater's network. The AD will need to automatically populate users and OUs in accordance with the organizational chart [orgchart1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PlwfzDsyQ_DB55CUZHhVj6TUMxBTrYlH/view)

   * Objective: Develop as a team a singular Powershell script that, when executed on a new installation of Windows Server, can fully standup all requisite services to make the server into a DC. Minimum required components of the script are listed in the [Project Guidelines](https://github.com/codefellows/seattle-ops-301n1/blob/main/class-15/project-guidelines.md) document. Each individual of the team is to contribute their share of the overall script and document their individual contribution. The final script should reflect an equal effort from all team members.

For the purposes of this project, only a single Windows 10 endpoint is required for demonstrating synchronization with the domain.

* Another pain point that GlobeX is experiencing is securely communicating to SunToWater's network resources. The VP of Special Projects has explicitly requested your team develop a secure solution for data transmission between the two networks, and demonstrate successful resource access in your upcoming presentation to the executive team.

  * Objective: Build a site-to-site VPN tunnel, altering at least one parameter compared to what was performed in class (e.g. router used, cloud, etc.). Demonstrate successful access to a file server on the other end of the tunnel.

* Finally, SunToWater has experienced a number of network intrusions in the past which has caused management to be concerned with our plans to join the two networks. They've requested your team implement some form of network access control that provides a healthy level of AAA security management. Your upcoming presentation should demonstrate evidence of AAA in your final configuration.

  * Objective: Deploy a RADIUS system that raises a captive portal for new network users and authenticates them using AD credentials.
For this IT project, your primary point of contact will be Michael Scott, Chief Operations Officer (COO) at SunToWater. Michael has been a critical contributor and decision-maker during this complex acquisition process, and can provide you with more detailed requirements as your progress through the project.
